# User Story:
<div>
    <ol>
        <li>
        As Keith Wesley, I want users to connect to their heroes on the battlefield and send motivational messages to them. I want to bridge the gap between soldiers and the population and make joining the military a more enticing choice of a career to those who may not see it that way.
        </li>
        <li>
        The military would benefit from a fanbase as it will raise troop morale, they will have a place where their comrades will be commemorated and have the general population want to join the army which will be of great use to their recruitment process.
        </li>
